<h1 class="page__title">About Me</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to my corner! I am a Senior undergraduate students in the <a href="https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/">Department of Electronic Engineering</a> at Tsinghua University, where I've had the privilege of engaging in a variety of scientific and technological activities, from robotics and microbial fermentation projects to exploring the complex problems in medical imaging and astronomical signals. Before that, I was actively involved in chemistry and biology competitions during high school, which gave me a solid foundation in life sciences and medicine. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but have also instilled in me a commitment to pushing the boundaries of interdisciplinary research.
</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I am an advocate for continuous learning, always seeking to expand my skill set. I believe in the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and the potential of technology to reshape the future. </p>

<h1 class="page__title">Research Interests</h1>

My academic interests span a broad spectrum, reflecting my interdisciplinary background. Here are a few areas that captivate my curiosity:

- **Biomedical AI and Medical Imaging:** Exploring innovative applications of technology in the healthcare sector to enhance diagnostics and treatment. Unraveling the mysteries of human body and other biological systems through computational approaches.
- **AI Security:** 
Migrating basic computer security principles learned in the class to machine learning and exploring advanced concepts in AI security to develop robust solutions for safeguarding machine learning models from issues such as backdoor attacks, sniffers, and data leaks.
- **Computer Vision:** Leveraging computer vision and generative model techniques to develop intelligent systems with an emphasis on medical imaging diagnosis and other practical applications.

I am particularly intrigued by projects that involve the convergence of these fields, aiming to create impactful solutions to real-world challenges.
